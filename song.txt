Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?


If a moment is all we are
We're quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do


If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
